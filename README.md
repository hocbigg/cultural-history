## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

These sections form the necessary backbone of the discipline. Study them in this exact order:

1. I. Foundations of Cultural History  
   Start here. This section teaches you the basic concepts, methods, and ways of reading cultural evidence that you will use throughout the entire curriculum.

2. II. Global Cultural History — Before 1500  
   Move to this section next. It gives you the long-term historical context of human societies before the modern era.

3. III. Global Cultural History — 1500–1800  
   Continue directly after section II. This covers the crucial period of global encounters, early empires, and the beginnings of the modern world.

4. IV. Global Cultural History — 1800–Present  
   Finish the broad historical spine here. This section brings the story up to the contemporary world.

Once you have completed sections I–IV in order, you will have a coherent, chronological understanding of global cultural history and the main tools needed to analyze it.

### Specialization Tracks – Choose after finishing the Core

After completing the Core (sections I–IV), move to the following two sections according to your interests:

- V. Thematic Cultural Systems  
  This section lets you explore major cultural domains (religion, art, gender, everyday life) across time. Work through the subsections that interest you most, or study all of them if you want a well-rounded view.

- VI. Interpretive Lenses  
  This section introduces powerful theoretical perspectives that help you ask deeper questions about culture, power, and change. Read these works after you have a solid historical foundation, and return to them as needed when analyzing specific topics.
